        <h2>The Seven habits of a Persistent Person.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>AN ALL-CONSUMING VISION-Persistent people have a goal or vision in mind that motivates and drives them. </li>
            <li>A BURNING DESIRE- Persistent people have the inner energy and intensity to keep them motivated and going through these tough times.</li>
            <li> INNER CONFIDENCE-While that inner confidence gets challenged and shaken, it never gets destroyed and constantly acts as a source of courage and determination.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY DEVELOPED HABITS -They have come to rely upon their self-discipline and developing habits they can count on to continue down the path toward their eventual goals.</li>
            <li> ABILITY TO ADJUST AND ADAPT -Persistent people have the ability to adjust and adapt their action plan.</li>
            </li>COMMITMENT TO LIFELONG LEARNING-Persistent people realize that any goal worth reaching will take time, effort, and continuously learning new skills and thinking patterns.</li>
            <li>ROLE MODELS THAT ACT AS GUIDES AND MENTORS-These can be people who are actually involved in their lives as mentors/confidantes or they can be figures who they have read about and who have deeply impacted them. You will know who these people are since persistent people will often quote them.</li>
